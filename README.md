>Alpha/Beta Minecraft hurt sound (ugh!) merged with new hit sounds, and removed background noise!

How it was done
------
Using [Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/), I ran the noise profiler on the old `hurt.ogg` sound, to remove a background noise that was present.

Merged `hurt.ogg` with `hit1.ogg`, and cut the `hurt.ogg` sound so it ended when `hit1.ogg` ended. This also removed a weird sound that was in the end of the sound file.

Repeated the process above for `hit2.ogg` and `hit3.ogg`, then saved them as `hit[1-3].ogg`.

No need to ask permission for use of my resource pack in any way, I probably won't reply, the answer is yes you are allowed to, and you don't need to notify me.

Reason why I use this license is because I did not create neither of these sounds. I simply ran a noise profiler on the old hurt sound to remove background noise, then I merged them. Do what the fuck you want with them, but it would be nice if you gave me credit!
