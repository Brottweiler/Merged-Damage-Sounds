Process
------
Using [Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/), I ran the noise profiler on the old `hurt.ogg` sound, to remove a background noise that was present.

Merged `hurt.ogg` with `hit1.ogg`, and cut the `hurt.ogg` sound so it ended when `hit1.ogg` ended. This also removed a weird sound that was in the end of the sound file.

Repeated the process above for `hit2.ogg` and `hit3.ogg`, then saved them as `hit[1-3].ogg`.

In recent Minecraft versions (Oct 2020), separate damage sounds were added for taking damage due to berry bushes, drowning and fire. These were also added.

Same goes for the old (floof!) and new (click!) flint and steel sounds. These were merged together.
