Alpha hurt sound (ugh!) merged with new hit sounds, and removed background noise!

Reason why I use this license is becuase I did not create neither of these sounds. I simply ran a noise profiler on the old hurt sound to remove background noise, then I merged them. Do what the fuck you want with them, but it would be nice if you gave me credit!

No need to ask permission for use of my resource pack in any way, I won't reply, the answer is yes you are allowed to, and you don't need to notify me.
