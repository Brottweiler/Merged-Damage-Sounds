>Alpha/Beta Minecraft hurt sound (ugh!) merged with new hit sounds, and removed background noise!

How it was done
------
Using [Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/), I ran the noise profiler on the old `hurt.ogg` sound, to remove a background noise that was present.

Merged `hurt.ogg` with `hit1.ogg`, and cut the `hurt.ogg` sound so it ended when `hit1.ogg` ended. This also removed a weird sound that was in the end of the sound file.

Repeated the process above for `hit2.ogg` and `hit3.ogg`, then saved them as `hit[1-3].ogg`.

**Update 2020-10-18**: In recent Minecraft versions, separate damage sounds were added for taking damage due to berry bushes, drowning and fire. These were also added.
